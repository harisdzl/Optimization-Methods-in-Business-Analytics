# Final Group Project for BT2103 (Optimization Methods in Business Analytics)
OBJECTIVE:
- In this project, we aim to create a classification model that can accurately identify customers who will default on their credit card payments in the next month.
- We will be utilizing Pythonâ€™s libraries to analyze, explore, process and analyze the dataset in order to come up with an accurate model for future bank default predictions. 
- At the end, we will evaluate the most accurate module using different evaluation methods, to estimate how well the model will perform when deployed.

MODELS:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Support Vector Machine

Evaluation:
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
